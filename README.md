# Project Title

AIdea is a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that takes user input as a prompt and generates responses. Additionally, it provides functionality to easily share generated content as posts on social media platforms with just one click.


## Tech Stack

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- NextAuth.js: Authentication library for Next.js applications.
- Prisma: A modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- Drizzle: A library for building scalable web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- tRPC: TypeScript RPC - a framework for building typesafe web APIs with TypeScript.


## Features

- User Interface with a chat window for prompt input   and post generation.
- Integration with LLM for processing user prompts and generating content.
- Pre-formatted post templates for various social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Medium).
- One-click sharing buttons for seamless social media integration.
